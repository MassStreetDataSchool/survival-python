Repo for CSCI120 Survival Python

## Repo Structure
This repo is broken up into 7 folders based on sections of the course. Each folder contains all of the example code files shown during the lectures. Each file should be named similar to the title of the lecture. 

**Example 1:** The first section with code examples is section 2 of this course. It is titled "Python Language Overview." One of the lectures within that section is titled "**Obligatory Hello World.**" the example file corresponding with that lecture is named: **obligatory_hello_world.py**

**Example 2:** Another lecture within the first section has multiple example files. The lecture is titled "**Variable Assignment**." The corresponding example files are named as follows: **variable_assigment_1.py**, **variable_assigment_2.py**, **variable_assigment_3.py**, 

This naming convention holds true throughout the whole course.
